DROP DATABASE xyzzy;

/* This SQL statement uses the DDL sublanguage
since it deletes everything about the structure
of the database and its table.
All variants of the DROP statement are generally
treated as DDL.

DROP DATABASE is DDL as its main purpose is to
operate on data definitions;
the deletion of data is a side effect. */
